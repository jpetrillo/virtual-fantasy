    <p class="introduction">I scavenge and collage to unpack and understand the world around me.</p><p class="introduction">I rummage through simulated alleyways, gathering still and moving images to try and find meaning in the trash.</p>
    <p class="introduction">I’m drawn to the blurred spaces between realities and fantasies.</p> 
    <p class="introduction">I lean into sickly sappiness, while pulling away with detached cynicism — weaving together camp and melodrama, constantly shifting back and forth.</p> 
    <p class="introduction">I immerse myself in digital landscapes, escaping into these spaces, I begin to desperately navigate through pixels and polygons to find deeper truths in the tangible world that surrounds us.</p>
    <p class="introduction">I take my findings and throw them in a blender, defamiliarizing the content that bombards us daily.</p>
    <p class="introduction">I take my mixture and hold it to a funhouse mirror — covered in vaseline and glitter — presenting a distorted reflection.</p>
    <p class="introduction">The screen is a blank canvas — an infinite universe with limitless possibilities. The warm glow of the screen washes over me, it feels comforting to remove myself from my material form.</p>
    <p class="introduction">But the screen threatens to consume me, I constantly have to remind myself to keep my distance.</p>
    <p class="introduction">Our current technological landscape threatens to engulf us, the new oligarchs of Silicon Valley are exploiting our thoughts, conversations, and bodies to merge our reality with their branded worlds — manipulating our agency for profit.</p>
    <p class="introduction">Virtual Fantasy is a proposition in opposition to virtual reality.</p>
    <p class="introduction">Fantasy is essential to queer survival — we daydream to escape the hetero-normative structures we’ve been forced to live in —  imagining new futures without binaries, linearity, or traditional notions of success.</p>
    <p class="introduction">By exploring immersion, escapism, and agency in our virtual worlds through a queer lens, VF offers a reframing of our relationship to VR — embracing digital spaces and their potential to imagine new futures and possibilities, while remaining present in the world around us, as we are here in our bodies, now.
