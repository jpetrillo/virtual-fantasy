  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">My fascination with romance reality television is complex and confusing, I consume both sincerely and ironically. I refuse to consider these narratives
    “guilty pleasures”, but I recognize the sparkling facade of authenticity.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">  
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I do not care if these narratives are true or false. My fascination comes from the detachment of identity these actors practice—selling their person-hood as an authentic citizen and existing in a blurred
    state of reality.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
   <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">A reality personality is simultaneously a public figure and a stage actor; they relinquish control of the narrative of their life.</h1>
  </div> 
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I am fascinated by the birth of reality television and its attempts at documenting the every day while simultaneously incorporating fabricated narratives to avoid the mundane.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">Reality television existed in a state of and/or, both real and fake; I watch closely hoping to categorize these moments.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">  
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I use the act of screenshotting as a method of subconsciously archiving and analyzing, attracted to both visual and verbal moments that feel strange and/or ridiculous, yet somehow poetic.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I gather these moments intentionally, rewinding over and over with fingers hovering over “command + shift + 3”, waiting patiently to capture the perfect moment.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I become more curious and ambitious, I begin recording and dissecting video footage. I collage these pieces as an attempt to unpack why I’m drawn to this genre.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">As an important documentation of American culture, I choose to study the first episodes of two shows — ABC’s <i>The Bachelorette</i> and Bravo’s <i>Boy Meets Boy</i>— both initially airing in early 2003.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">  
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I build a shrine for my shows as an exercise in worship.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I kneel at my altar and reflect.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I am a child of the information age, bombarded by content.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">My developing brain subconsciously formed associations of the world through the lens of media.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I did not see queer romance on mainstream television.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I passively relied on the unintentional homo-eroticism17 in these hyper-traditional shows to understand sexuality and affection.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">My relationship with love and sex is complex and confusing, I am relationship adverse but voyeuristically drawn to romances—both fictional and real.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I peer into these worlds dumbfounded by the sickly sweet sincerity.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I seek validation from male attention; I crave to be desired, using and discarding the bodies of men to confirm my self worth.</h1>
  </div>  
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I act as a self-destructive fruit, sacrificing safety for anonymity and transience.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I do not believe I deserve to be treated with tenderness.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I cringe at the idea of desiring love.</h1>
  </div> 
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">At times, I do not care who I share a bed with. I need to be reminded I am good—that I am valid—that I deserve to be wanted and consumed.</h1>
  </div>        
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">This is normal. This is good. This is gay culture.</h1>
  </div>          
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I try to convince myself that this is true26, but I feel empty.</h1>
  </div>            
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I am an object27 to be consumed and discarded.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">My fascination with romance reality television is complex and confusing, I watch the sickly sweetness with a detached irony.</h1>
  </div>              
  <div class="times-container">    
    <h1 class="h2-times_heart" style="color: red;">I envy the uncomplicated relationship with intimacy that these actors project.</h1>
