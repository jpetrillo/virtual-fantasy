  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_bloom">&#8226;<br>Pick a day. It can be any day really, maybe it’s your birthday or an anniversary of something special — maybe it’s your favorite day from last week or maybe it’s even today.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_bloom">&#8226;&#8226;<br>Think about what makes this day special. It could help to close your eyes and try to imagine this day. What does it feel like? Look like? Smell like? What is the weather like? Does your day have a taste? Think about why you chose this day and write it all down.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_bloom">&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;<br>Look at your writing and circle your favorite word or phrase. This is now the name of your new holiday (you could put ‘day’ after if it helps).</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_bloom">&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;<br>Now what happens on your holiday? And where? Can anyone participate or would you rather keep the holiday to yourself? It may help to think about your holiday’s name or an activity you’d like to repeat.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_bloom">&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;<br>Holidays don’t always need to be experienced at regular intervals. How often does your holiday happen? You make the rules, so anything goes.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="times-container">
    <h1 class="h2-times_bloom">&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;<br>Now it’s time to craft an invitation. Don’t worry, this should be easy. An email, text, or printed note will work — it could evenbe word of mouth. It could help to start small with friends or family and grow your holiday in the future. What’s most important is: how can we all start to celebrate with you?</h1>
